# Disaster Recovery System

## Overview
AI-powered disaster recovery system providing intelligent backup, recovery, and business continuity solutions for the Universal Project system.

## Features

### AI-Powered Backup
- **Intelligent Backup Scheduling**: AI-driven backup frequency based on data change patterns
- **Data Classification**: Automatic classification of critical vs. non-critical data
- **Incremental Backup Optimization**: Smart delta backups to minimize storage and time
- **Cross-Platform Backup**: Support for multiple storage backends (local, cloud, hybrid)
- **Backup Validation**: Automated integrity checks and restoration testing

### Recovery Management
- **RTO/RPO Optimization**: AI-optimized Recovery Time and Recovery Point Objectives
- **Automated Recovery**: One-click disaster recovery with AI-guided restoration
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Granular recovery to any point in time
- **Cross-Environment Recovery**: Recovery across different environments and regions
- **Recovery Testing**: Automated recovery testing and validation

### Business Continuity
- **Failover Automation**: Automatic failover to backup systems
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent traffic distribution during recovery
- **Data Synchronization**: Real-time data synchronization across sites
- **Compliance**: Automated compliance reporting for disaster recovery
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated recovery procedures and runbooks
