## Distribution Strategies

### 1. AI-Optimized (Default)
Uses machine learning models to find the best match between tasks and developers based on:
- Skill compatibility
- Workload balance
- Learning opportunities
- Historical performance
- Collaboration requirements

### 2. Priority-Based
Assigns tasks based on priority and urgency:
- Critical tasks get immediate assignment
- High-priority tasks assigned to best available developers
- Considers deadline proximity

### 3. Workload-Balanced
Ensures even distribution of work:
- Monitors current workload of all developers
- Assigns tasks to developers with lower workload
- Prevents overloading individual developers

### 4. Learning-Optimized
Focuses on skill development:
- Identifies tasks that match developer learning goals
- Assigns tasks that help fill skill gaps
- Balances learning with productivity

### 5. Deadline-Driven
Prioritizes based on deadlines:
- Tasks with closer deadlines get priority
- Assigns to developers who can complete before deadline
- Considers task complexity and developer capacity

### 6. Adaptive
Learns from past performance:
- Analyzes historical distribution success
- Adapts strategy based on current context
- Continuously optimizes for better results

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics
- **Workload Imbalance**: Measures how evenly work is distributed
- **Skill Utilization**: Tracks how well skills are being used
- **Performance Efficiency**: Monitors task completion efficiency
- **Deadline Compliance**: Tracks on-time delivery rates

### Alert Types
- **Workload Imbalance**: When workload distribution exceeds threshold
- **Performance Drop**: When efficiency decreases significantly
- **Deadline Risk**: When tasks are at risk of missing deadlines
