## Usage Examples

### Create a Simple Workflow
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3019/api/workflows \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "workflowData": {
      "name": "Simple Data Processing",
      "description": "Process and validate data",
      "type": "sequential",
      "tasks": [
        {
          "id": "task1",
          "name": "Validate Input",
          "type": "data",
          "config": {
            "operation": "validate",
            "data": "$input",
            "config": {
              "schema": "string"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "id": "task2",
          "name": "Transform Data",
